# üöÄ Wild Rydes: Full-Stack Cloud Application üåü  

I'm excited to showcase my **AWS Full-Stack Project: Wild Rydes**, where I combined multiple AWS services to create a functional cloud-based ride-sharing app (for unicorns! ü¶Ñ). This project highlights the integration of serverless architecture with robust authentication and secure APIs.

   - Leveraged **Cognito** for a secure and user-friendly login system.  

2. **Backend Logic**:  
   - Built serverless functions with **Lambda**, handling ride requests and interactions.  

3. **Database Integration**:  
   - Stored and retrieved ride data using **DynamoDB** with seamless API integration.  

4. **API Management**:  
   - Configured **API Gateway** with CORS and Cognito authorization for secure access.  

5. **Deployment**:  
   - Fully operational app deployed via **Amplify Gen 2**, with CI/CD pipelines for automated updates.
